# TakumiApp

## Overview

TakumiApp is a Kotlin Multiplatform project that serves as a playground for experimenting with the latest technologies and architectural patterns in mobile development. The primary goal of this repository is to explore and implement cutting-edge solutions for building modern, scalable, and maintainable applications for Android and iOS from a single codebase. This project is in constant evolution.

This project is not intended as a production-ready application, but rather as a learning and experimentation environment.

## Architecture

The project follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**, with a clear separation of concerns between the data, domain, and presentation layers. This is further enforced by a modular structure that promotes scalability, maintainability, and testability.

### Modules

*   **`:composeApp`**: The main application module, responsible for orchestrating the user interface and navigation.
*   **`:shared:common`**: A common module containing shared utilities, extensions, and constants.
*   **`:shared:data`**: The data layer, responsible for fetching and storing data from various sources (e.g., REST APIs, local database).
*   **`:shared:domain`**: The domain layer, containing the business logic and use cases of the application.
*   **`:shared:presentation:designsystem`**: A dedicated module for the design system, including custom themes, typography, and reusable UI components.
*   **`:shared:presentation:features`**: A collection of feature modules, each representing a distinct feature of the application (e.g., character list, character details).

## Tech-Stack & Concepts

This project is a sandbox for playing with a variety of modern tools and concepts.

*   **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Sharing code between Android and iOS.
*   **Compose Multiplatform**: Building UIs for both platforms from a single, declarative codebase.
*   **Material 3**: The latest version of Google's open-source design system.
*   **Clean Architecture**: Enforcing separation of concerns for a scalable and maintainable codebase.
*   **Feature-based Modularization**: Structuring the app by features.
*   **Ktor**: For networking.
*   **Koin**: For dependency injection.
*   **Coil**: For image loading.
*   **Gradle Convention Plugins**: To manage dependencies and project setup in a centralized way.
*   **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: For asynchronous programming.
